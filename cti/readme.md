Threat Intelligence covers the process of collecting, processing, identifying and analyzing data about cyber threats in order to better understand them. 

![CTI for OXA](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/oxa/assets/145455635/f82aee53-22fa-4d7f-83bd-b31f54ca9ae4)

Threat Intelligence enables organizations to make faster, smarter and better-informed security decisions. It encourages proactive, rather than reactive, behavior in the ongoing fight against cyber-attacks.

In order to better disseminate threat intelligence along security components within an organization, OXA will rely on two complementary CTI standards : STIX & TAXII. 
- STIX (Structured Threat Information Expression) is a standardized, structured language for representing information on cyber threats, and in particular indicators of compromise (IOCs) that were obtained through Threat Intelligence
- TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information) is a protocol designed to facilitate the exchange of CTI-type information, formatted in STIX.

These standards, when correctly used, enable corporate security teams to be informed about the attacks they are most likely to suffer, so they can adapt and respond to them as quickly and effectively as possible. 
The use of these standards allows to promote a globalized approach to Threat Intelligence. Indeed, smart information sharing ensures that a threat signal known  at one point in the security chain will be disseminated  everywhere in the ecosystem. 
OXA aims at leveraging TAXII for the distribution of a robust CTI that can feed different security components, each of them being interested in different kinds of threat intelligence artifacts.
