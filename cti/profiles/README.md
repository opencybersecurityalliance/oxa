# Profile capabilities for CTI use

Each profile defines a list of STIX observables that can be used for a specific consumer.
A consumer is a product (a technical component) willing to get access to the threat intel to achieve different goals:
- Bring more detection capability locally
- Enrich part of a local workflow for this component
- Prioritize on what is the most dangerous for a customer
