An API is an Application Programming Interface that connects a piece of software or a service to another in order to exchange data and features.

Hence, OXA is working on building an OpenAPI in order to allow security components (letâ€™s name them Open XDR Front End sensors) to benefit from all Open XDR back end side fonctionnalities. This open API shall allow to govern all interactions that may separate,on the one hand, the world of security products installed on or for the customer environment, and on the other hand, the entire central environment and its components. This interface, once enforced by security products, will enable them to guarantee their interoperability with the back end XDR environment of any organization.

To date, there is no existing international standard to respond to such needs. The OXA project will develop this OpenAPI interface to be used globally.
