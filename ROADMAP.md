OXA is framework that defines the rules and principles but some areas relating with XDR should be strenghtened

# Interaction between framework and tools
## Meshroom interaction
Meshroom is an offiliated project of OXA but the link should be made stronger to have a full alignment between both. Some key improvement ideas could be:
- create a basic front-end environment to onboard cybersecurity vendors or integrators faster to create their integration
- promote the Meshroom repository and especially the directory where integrations are publicly released

## OCSF
- Some OCSF initiatives are probably missed and could bring value to OXA as well

## Scope extension
- New scope possibility. The detection part, with the idea to leverage Sigma, the de-facto community adopted format could be interesting. A simple link to the main repositories of validated rules could be a first step
- New scope possibility. The hunting part, with the idea to leverage one of the de-facto community adopted query language (KQL, SPL...). A simple link to the main repositories of validated queries could be a first step

## CTI 
- A contribution for the identification of CTI providers able to provide a link to allow the consumption of their profile-based feed would be great

## Playbooks
- Broader examples of shared playbooks would be great

## Automation
- The capability to better categorize technical scope of products and define a required list of actionable capabilities could probably be reviewed and be integrated into the API scope

## API
- The OpenAPI spec could certainly be widely improved, aligned with the ability to cover a wider scope as defined before or be more precise to activate specific endpoints (ie for automated actions).
- The OpenAPI spec could eventually be separated into two parts, one for the sensor side, one for the analytics side
